# SC_SPM_sims
Evaluating violations of independence 

Scripts with 1 generate and explore data
Scripts with 2 run the Spatial Count (Chandler and Royle) and Spatial Partial Identity (Augustine) models
SCripts with 3 postprocess and summarize

To do:
- for coverage plots, consider ribbons connecting the maxes to maxes and mins to mins, rather than a line segment through the median/mean
- reorder the factors for SC, SPIM: 4 , and SPIM: 3
- figure out a way to quantify the amount of ID info given pop size and partial id covs.. (read ben's paper and also L. Waits)

Finished:
- run antler sex coat collar
